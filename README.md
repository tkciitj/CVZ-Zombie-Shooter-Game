# CVZ-Zombie-Shooter-Game

CVZ: Cube vs Zombies is an interactive shooting game built from scratch using C and the SDL2 library. This is a fun action-packed and challenging game in which you must survive against incoming swarms of various enemies and gain as many points as you can!

 We built this as a Major Project in our introduction to computer-science course (ICS-1010) in IIT Jodhpur.



## Features

1. Main Menu and Pause Menu to provide a more interactive experience.

2. Theme Music to maintain the game atmosphere.

3. Player movement using W, A, S, D keys and either of their combination for diagonal movement.

4. Collision detection with maze walls and doors.

5. Enemies with different characteristics(damage, points dropped, speed) (Zombies, Witches, Bosses).

6. Health, points and ammo system.

7. Randomly spawning treasures with claimable loot.

8. Allows Room Change, when the player reaches a certain amount of points.
